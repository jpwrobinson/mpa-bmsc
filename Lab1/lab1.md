## Lab 1 

#### Notes, tips and useful links

**Lab 1 aims to teach you how to build maps in R, import GIS data , and analyse polygons to estimate habitat features.** 

The **LAB 1 instructions.docx** on the moodle site has all of the instructions and objectives for this lab. 

We will be using ggplot (an R package) combined with Google Maps to make simple aerial maps, and then polygons and GPS co-ordinates to analyse habitat data.

There are many, many tools that allow you to make maps in R, and we will only scratch the surface with this course. Check out these links for tutorials and examples of how to improve your R mapmaking skills:
