##Getting started in R

**1. What is R?**

First of all, read 'What is R?' on the R webpage: http://www.r-project.org

RStudio is the program you will run 'R' through. You must have R to run RStudio. Open RStudio and let's take a lookâ€¦..
RStudio provides a nice GUI (graphical user interface) to use R in, which there are four windows:

*upper left*: where your R scripting files will be located

*lower left*: the R console (i.e. where the R command line is

*upper right*: where your R history and workspace are

*lower right*: where you can open files, view plots, install R packagesand get R help

R is the console - this is where the data is kept, where you run analyses, where you create plots. The script is a text file that contains the code for everything you do - save this regularly and annotate with #.

We send code from the script to the console with command + enter (control + enter on Windows).

**2. So, what can I do in R?**

R is a fantastic open-source program for manipulating data, statistical analysis, and making figures.

At its most simple, R is a calculator.

    1 + 10

We can store functions, data, numbers, and words using the assign command.

    a <- 10
    a
    animal <- "parrotfish"
    animal

R has built-in functions, such as mean(), max() and min().

    mean(1,5,5, 8)
    ## mean = 1??
    
See how to use the mean function with
	
	?mean
	
This tells us we need to tell R to use a single object (x) to calculate means. We use little 'c' to save objects.

	numbers<-c(1,5,5,8)
	mean(numbers)
	max(numbers)

As a first example, let's write a simple function and make a plot. First, open a new R script file, and comment it with your name, date, and purpose.

*'#' is not interpreted as code - we use # for commenting our scripts*

**Comment everything!** - you will need to revisit your scripts, and comments help to explain what your code actually means

    #Started April 18th, by JKB
    #Purpose: To start learning R


        a<-seq(1,10,1)    # create an object 'a' which is a sequence from 1 to 10
        b<-seq(10,500,50)  # create an object 'b' which is a sequence from 10 to 500, by 50 each time
        plot(a,b, main="My first plot in R") ## plot a against b

**To get help in R**, type '?' plus the function you want help with in the command line. For example:

    ?seq

This will open a help file on 'seq' in the lower right hand window of R Studio. This help file tells us that the numbers inside the brackets after 'seq' are the 'arguments' to the function sequence. For the function sequence, the 1st number is the number the sequence starts at, the 2nd number is the number the sequence ends at, and the 3rd
number is the amount the sequence increments by. So in our example above a is a sequence that runs from 1 to 10 by 1.

**3. Functions in R**

But what if you want to run all three lines at once? That's where a function comes in. We usually use functions when we want to run a series of commands in one line - you might do this to simplify your script, or just to save time typing code.


Functions use curly brackets {} to contain commands. In the command line type:

    my.first.function <- function(){
        a<-seq(1,10,1)
        b<-seq(10,500,50)
        plot(a,b, main="My first plot in R")
    }

    my.first.function()
    
  Functions can get much much more complicated. In fact, everything you do in R is just a function that someone else has written - you don't actually need to look at the function code, just use the help files to figure out how to use each function.

**4. Setting Your Working Directory**

Data management (keeping track of code, figures, data) is **essential** for any researcher. If you can get good at this early on you'll save future you a huge amount of time and effort. 

In the command line, type:

    getwd()


This will tell you what directory (also known as a folder) R has opened in, and this is where your R workspace will be located.

You want your R workspace to be located in the R folder for the project you are currently working on. We can then set the working directory using the 'setwd'  function (where setwd stands for 'set working directory'):


    setwd("Users/James/Desktop/mpa-bmsc")


*Note that you need to include the full path name* 

Use this line at the start of your R script for all of these tutorials - that way, all of your scripts and notes will be kept in the same location and you won't lose track of anything!

**5. Reading in data in R**

We work with csv file formats in R - you can create these for your own data using excel (File > Save As > .csv). Most online data is provided in csv format.

	dataset<-read.csv(filename.csv)

To look at a dataset we can just type its name

	dataset
	
But that doesn't work for bigger datasets - instead we usually use head() or tail() to look at the top and bottom of a dataset.
	
	head(dataset)
	tail(dataset)
	
	
**6. Now what?**
There are a number of resources available for learning R. We have posted a few of these resources on the course website. If you run into problems, try to resolve them yourself, then consult your classmates, your TA, or the professor. Feel free to ask questions after lectures/labs.

Here are a few resources on R that I've found useful.
